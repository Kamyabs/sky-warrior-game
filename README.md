# sky warrior game
a 2D action game build by python and turtle library

hello this is a simple but fun game that i wrote in pure python version 3 
with free/open source materials(images and sounds)

you can play it as a game to have fun 
or
use its code as a teacher for edu purpose
or
anything .. :)


list of library used in this project:
-turtle
  for main brain to show every thing 
-pygame
  just for handle sounds
    i used https://opengameart.org/content/quirky-fast-dnb-8bit-drums-and-bass-lmfao this song for playback music
-pandas
  for managing high score and read/write csv

how to run:
python3 main.py

this is my very first game project that i build it from 0 to 100 by myself
please let me know if you play it and feel its fun
or
if you want to make it even better like use online database for score/user managing or add booses to game
or
